# Package dists
# Packages can contain any kind of file, but usually
# consist of pure Python code (i.e., not an executable)
# and are used to distribute code in a manageable
# form. Package dists include the package code, as well
# as any dependent packages needed to run the package.
# Usually created using the distutils module.
#
# This is not intended to refer to the kind of package
# that you "dist" using the distutils module (although
# that type of package can contain pure Python code).
#
# Instead, it refers to the kind of file that contains
# pure python code and is used to distribute that code.
# Do not confuse this type of package with the type of
# package that you "dist" using the distutils module,
# which can contain any kind of file (i.e., not just
# pure Python code).
